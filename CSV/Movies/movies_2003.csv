A critique of the policies of Boris Yeltsin, it depicted the economic crisis that followed Russia's transition towards a free market economy, and with it, a lost generation, with no job security, who are pushed into a world of crime and rebellion. Despite a modest budget of US$700,000, and a limited cinematic release, it became a national hit in Russia as well its soundtrack, popularized by 'Seryoga's' (Серёга) music video ""Чёрный Бумер"" (""Black Bummer""). Both the film and its soundtrack have won awards, including the prestigious Golden Aries from the Russian Guild of Film critics."
