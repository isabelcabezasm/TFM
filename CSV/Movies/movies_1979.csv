The film underlines of love, friendship and -richness in the poorness- and also is a story about the people who prefers love, instead of money and fortune. The theme and narration may include some populist elements -like most Kemal Sunal films- but generally tells its story as well. The story is familiar to Turkish audience: A young man loves young girl.

147168;Gloria!;;;Unknown;0;;;Unknown;0;;;Unknown;0;;;Unknown;0;In GLORIA! Frampton juxtaposes nineteenth-century concerns with contemporary forms through the interfacing of a work of early cinema with a videographic display of textual material. These two formal components (the film and the texts) in turn relate to a nineteenth-century figure, Frampton's maternal grandmother, and to a twentieth-century one, her grandson (filmmaker Frampton himself). In attempting to recapture their relationship, GLORIA! becomes a somewhat comic, often touching meditation on death, on memory and on the power of image, music and text to resurrect the past.
